# Out of the Box Delivery Basic

This package provides a reusable ClusterDelivery object that delivers the
Kubernetes configuration that the Out of the Box Supply Chain produces to an
environment, including [Basic](ootb-supply-chain-basic.html),
[Testing](ootb-supply-chain-testing.html), and [Testing With
Scanning](ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.html) supply chains.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

To make use of this package you must have installed:

- [Supply Chain Cartographer](../install-online/components.hbs.md#install-scc)
- [Out of the Box Templates](ootb-templates.html)

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Using Out of the Box Delivery Basic

Out of the Box Delivery Basic support both GitOps and local development workflows:

```text
GITOPS

    Deliverable:
      points at a git repository where source code is found and
      kubernetes configuration is pushed to


LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

    Deliverable:

      points at a container image registry where the supplychain
      pushes source code and configuration to


---

DELIVERY

    takes a Deliverable (local or gitops) and passes is through
    a series of resources:


           config-provider  <---[config]--- deployer
                 .                             .
                 .                             .
    GitRepository/ImageRepository         kapp-ctrl/App
                                                - knative/Service
                                                - ResourceClaim
                                                - ServiceBinding
                                                ...
```

You must install this package to have Workloads delivered properly with the
[Basic](ootb-supply-chain-basic.html),
[Testing](ootb-supply-chain-testing.html), and [Testing With
Scanning](ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.html) Out of the Box Supply Chains.

Consumers do not interact directly with this package. Instead, this package is
used after the supply chains create a
[carto.run/Deliverable](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer) object to
express the intention of having the Workloads that go through them delivered to
an environment. The environment is the same Kubernetes cluster as the Supply
Chains.
