# Tanzu Apps CLI overview

This topic gives you an overview of the Tanzu Apps CLI. Use the Tanzu Apps CLI to create, view,
update, and delete application workloads on any Kubernetes cluster that has the Tanzu Application
Platform (commonly known as TAP) components installed.

## <a id='about'></a>About workloads

Tanzu Application Platform enables developers to quickly build and test applications regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes.
Developers can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.

A workload enables developers to choose application specifications, such as repository location, environment variables, service binding, and more.
For more information on workload creation and management, see [Command Reference](command-reference.md).

Tanzu Application Platform can support a range of workloads, including a serverless process that starts on demand, a constellation of microservices that functions as a logical application, or a small hello-world test app.
