# Overview of API Auto Registration

This topic provides an overview of API Auto Registration for Tanzu Application Platform.

## Overview

API Auto Registration automates the registration of API specification defined in
a workload's configuration. The registered API specification is accessible in
Tanzu Application Platform GUI without any additional steps. An automated
workflow using a supply chain, leverages API Auto Registration to create and
manage a Kubernetes Custom Resource (CR) of kind `APIDescriptor`. A Kubernetes
controller periodically reconciles the CR and updates the API entity in Tanzu
Application Platform GUI to achieve automated API specification registration
from origin workloads. You might also use API Auto Registration without supply
chain automation, with other GitOps processes, or by directly applying an
`APIDescriptor` CR to the cluster.
