# Install Tanzu Application Platform through GitOps with External Secrets Operator (ESO)

>**Caution** Tanzu Application Platform (GitOps) is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use in a production environment.

<!-- TODO: use markdown-generated anchor values to ease navigating within VS Code (and validating links). -->

This topic tells you how to install Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP) 
through GitOps with secrets managed in an external secrets store. 
To decide which approach to use, see [Choosing SOPS or ESO](reference.hbs.md#choosing-sops-or-eso).

Tanzu GitOps Reference Implememtation (RI) does not support changing the secrets management strategy for a cluster.
The External Secrets Operator integration in this release of Tanzu GitOps RI
is verified to support AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service cluster with AWS Secrets Manager.
Other combinations of Kubernetes distribution and ESO providers are not verified.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before installing Tanzu Application Platform, ensure you have:

- Completed the [Prerequisites](../prerequisites.hbs.md).
- Created [AWS Resources](../install-aws/resources.hbs.md).
- [Accepted Tanzu Application Platform EULA and installed Tanzu CLI](../install-tanzu-cli.hbs.md) with any required plug-ins.
- Installed [Cluster Essentials for Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/{{ vars.url_version }}/cluster-essentials/deploy.html).
- Installed [eksctl CLI](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl#installation).

## <a id='relocate-images-to-a-registry'></a> Relocate images to a registry

VMware recommends relocating the images from VMware Tanzu Network registry to your own container image registry before
attempting installation. If you don't relocate the images, Tanzu Application Platform depends on
VMware Tanzu Network for continued operation, and VMware Tanzu Network offers no uptime guarantees.
The option to skip relocation is documented for evaluation and proof-of-concept only.

The supported registries are Harbor, Azure Container Registry, Google Container Registry,
and Quay.io.
See the following documentation for a registry to learn how to set it up:

- [Harbor documentation](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.5.0/)
- [Google Container Registry documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs)
- [Quay.io documentation](https://docs.projectquay.io/welcome.html)

To relocate images from the VMware Tanzu Network registry to your registry:

1. Set up environment variables for installation use by running:

    ```console
    export IMGPKG_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME_0=registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    export IMGPKG_REGISTRY_USERNAME_0=MY-TANZUNET-USERNAME
    export IMGPKG_REGISTRY_PASSWORD_0=MY-TANZUNET-PASSWORD
    export IMGPKG_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME_1=MY-REGISTRY
    export IMGPKG_REGISTRY_USERNAME_1=MY-REGISTRY-USER
    export IMGPKG_REGISTRY_PASSWORD_1=MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=MY-REGISTRY-USER
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=MY-REGISTRY
    export TAP_VERSION=VERSION-NUMBER
    export INSTALL_REPO=TARGET-REPOSITORY
    ```

    Where:

    - `MY-REGISTRY-USER` is the user with write access to `MY-REGISTRY`.
    - `MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password for `MY-REGISTRY-USER`.
    - `MY-REGISTRY` is your own container registry.
    - `MY-TANZUNET-USERNAME` is the user with access to the images in the VMware Tanzu Network registry `registry.tanzu.vmware.com`.
    - `MY-TANZUNET-PASSWORD` is the password for `MY-TANZUNET-USERNAME`.
    - `VERSION-NUMBER` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.
    - `TARGET-REPOSITORY` is your target repository, a folder or repository on `MY-REGISTRY` that serves as the location
    for the installation files for Tanzu Application Platform.

    VMware recommends using a JSON key file to authenticate with Google Container Registry.
    In this case, the value of `INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME` is `_json_key` and
    the value of `INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is the content of the JSON key file.
    For more information about how to generate the JSON key file,
    see [Google Container Registry documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication).

1. [Install the Carvel tool `imgpkg` CLI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/{{ vars.url_version }}/cluster-essentials/deploy.html#optionally-install-clis-onto-your-path).

    To query for the available versions of Tanzu Application Platform on VMWare Tanzu Network Registry, run:

    ```console
    imgpkg tag list -i registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages | sort -V
    ```

1. Relocate the images with the `imgpkg` CLI by running:

    ```console
    imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages:${TAP_VERSION} --to-repo ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/tap-packages
    ```

## <a id='airgap-support'></a> (Optional) Install Tanzu Application Platform in an air-gapped environment

Complete the following steps if you install Tanzu Application Platform in an air-gapped environment:

1. Relocate the Tanzu Build Service images to your registry:

    ```console
    imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/full-tbs-deps-package-repo:VERSION --to-repo ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/full-tbs-deps-package-repo
    ```

    Where:

    - `VERSION` is the version of Tanzu Build Service. You can retrieve this value by running `kubectl get package -n tap-install | grep buildservice`

1. [Configure custom certificate authorities for Tanzu Application Platform GUI](../install-offline/tap-gui-non-standard-certs-offline.hbs.md).

1. Host a `grype` database in the air-gapped environment. For more information, see [Use Grype in offline and air-gapped environments](../install-offline/grype-offline-airgap.hbs.md).

## <a id='create-a-new-git-repository'></a>Create a new Git repository

1. In a hosted Git service, for example, GitHub or GitLab, create a new respository.

    This version of Tanzu GitOps RI only supports authenticating to a hosted Git repository by using SSH.

1. Initialize a new Git repository:

    ```console
    mkdir -p $HOME/tap-gitops
    cd $HOME/tap-gitops

    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:my-organization/tap-gitops.git
    ```

1. Create a read-only deploy key for this new repository (recommended) or SSH key for an account with read access to this repository.

    The private portion of this key is referred to as `GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.

## <a id='download-and-unpack-tanzu-gitops-ri'></a>Download and unpack Tanzu GitOps Reference Implementation (RI)

1. Sign in to [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).

1. Go to the [Tanzu Application Platform product page](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform).

1. Select **Release {{ vars.tap_version }}** from the release drop-down menu.

1. Click **Tanzu GitOps Reference Implementation**.

1. Unpack the downloaded TGZ file into the `$HOME/tap-gitops` directory by running:

    ```console
    tar -xvf tanzu-gitops-ri-*.tgz -C $HOME/tap-gitops
    ```

1. Commit the initial state:

    ```console
    cd $HOME/tap-gitops

    git add . && git commit -m "Initialize Tanzu GitOps RI"
    git push -u origin
    ```

## <a id='create-cluster-configuration'></a>Create cluster configuration

1. Seed configuration for a cluster using ESO through the provided convenience script:

    ```console
    cd $HOME/tap-gitops

    ./setup-repo.sh CLUSTER-NAME eso
    ```

    Where:

    - `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name for your cluster. Typically, this is the same as your EKS cluster's name, the name of the cluster as it appears in `eksctl get clusters`.
    - `eso` selects the External Secrets Operator-based secrets management variant.

    For example, if the name of your cluster is `iterate-green`:

    ```console
    cd $HOME/tap-gitops

    ./setup-repo.sh iterate-green eso
    ```

    This script creates the directory `clusters/iterate-green/` and copies in the
    configuration required to sync this Git repository with the cluster and installing Tanzu Application Platform.

2. Commit and push:

    ```console
    git add . && git commit -m 'Add "iterate-green" cluster'
    git push
    ```

    Saving the base configuration in an initial commit makes it easier to review customizations in the future.

## <a id='customize-cluster-configuration'></a>Customize cluster configuration

Configuring the Tanzu Application Platform installation involves setting up two components:

- an installation of Tanzu Application Platform;
- an instance of Tanzu Sync, the component that implements the GitOps workflow,
fetching configuration from Git and applying it to the cluster.

Follow these steps to customize your Tanzu Application Platform cluster configuration:

1. Navigate to the created directory:

    ```console
    cd clusters/CLUSTER-NAME
    ```

    For example, if the name of your cluster is `iterate-green`:

    ```console
    cd clusters/iterate-green
    ```

1. Define the following environment variables:

    ```console
    export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=MY-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID
    export AWS_REGION=AWS-REGION
    export EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=EKS-CLUSTER-NAME
    export TAP_PKGR_REPO=TAP-PACKAGE-OCI-REPOSITORY
    ```

    Where:

    - `MY-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID` is your AWS account ID as it appears in the output of `aws sts get-caller-identity`.
    - `AWS-REGION` is the region where the Secrets Manager is and the EKS cluster was created.
    - `EKS-CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the target cluster as it appears in the output of `eksctl get clusters`.
    - `TAP-PACKAGE-OCI-REPOSITORY` is the fully-qualified path to the OCI repository hosting the Tanzu Application Platform images.
    If they are relocated to a different registry as described in [Relocate images to a registry](#relocate-images-to-a-registry),
    the value is `${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/tap-packages`.

### <a id='grant-read-access-to-secret-data'></a>Grant read access to secret data

All sensitive configuration is stored in AWS Secrets Manager secrets.
Both Tanzu Sync and the Tanzu Application Platform installation require access to this sensitive data.

Follow these step to configure the [IAM Role for a Service Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html):

1. In AWS Identity and Access Manager, create two IAM Policies, one to read Tanzu Sync secrets
and another to read the Tanzu Application Platform installation secrets by using the supplied script:

    ```console
    tanzu-sync/scripts/aws/create-policies.sh
    ```

2. Create two IAM Role-to-Service Account pairs for your cluster, one for Tanzu Sync
and anther for the Tanzu Application Platform installation by using the supplied script:

    ```console
    tanzu-sync/scripts/aws/create-irsa.sh
    ```

    For example, if the name of the EKS cluster is `iterate-green` using the defaults,
    there are two IAM roles in the AWS account:

    ```json
    $ aws iam list-roles --query 'Roles[?starts_with(RoleName,`iterate-green`)]'
    [
       {
           "RoleName": "iterate-green--tanzu-sync-secrets",
           ...
       },
       {
           "RoleName": "iterate-green--tap-install-secrets",
           ...
       }
    ]
    ```

### <a id='generate-default-configuration'></a>Generate default configuration

You can use the following script to generate default configuration for the both
Tanzu Sync and Tanzu Application Platform installation:

```console
tanzu-sync/scripts/configure.sh
```

The following sections guide you through the process of editing the configuration
values to suit your specific needs.

### <a id='reviewstore-tanzu-sync-config'></a>Review and store Tanzu Sync config

Configuration for Tanzu is stored in two locations:

- sensitive configuration is stored in AWS Secrets Manager;
- non-sensitive configuration are stored in YAML files in the Git repository.

Follow these steps to create the sensitive configuration and review the non-sensitive configuration:

1. Save the credentials that Tanzu Sync uses to authenticate with the Git repository:

    Create a secret named `dev/EKS-CLUSTER-NAME/tanzu-sync/sync-git-ssh` containing
    the following information as plaintext:

    ```json
    {
     "ssh-privatekey": "... (private key portion here) ...",
     "ssh-knownhosts": "... (known_hosts for git host here) ..."
    }
    ```

    Where `EKS-CLUSTER-NAME` is the name as it appears in `eksctl get clusters`.

    For example, if the Git repository is hosted on GitHub, and the private key
    created in [Create a new Git repository](#create-a-new-git-repository) is stored in the file `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`:

    ```console
    aws secretsmanager create-secret \
       --name dev/${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}/tanzu-sync/sync-git-ssh \
       --secret-string "$(cat <<EOF
    {
     "ssh-privatekey": "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 | awk '{printf "%s\\\\n", $0}')",
     "ssh-knownhosts": "$(ssh-keyscan github.com | awk '{printf "%s\\\\n", $0}')"
    }
    EOF
    )"
    ```

    Where:

    - The content of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` is the private portion of the SSH key.
    - `ssh-keyscan` obtains the public keys for the SSH host.
    - `awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}'` converts a multiline string into a single-line
    string with embedded newline chars (`\n`). JSON does not support multiline strings.

    >**Caution**
    >
    > This version of Tanzu GitOps RI only supports authenticating to a hosted Git repository by using SSH.
    > Authenticating by using HTTP Basic Authentication is not supported.

2. Save the authentication credentials required for accessing the OCI registry that
hosts the Tanzu Application Platform images by creating a secret named `dev/EKS-CLUSTER-NAME/tanzu-sync/install-registry-dockerconfig`
containing the following information as plaintext:

    ```json
    {
      "auths": {
        "MY-REGISTRY": {
          "username": "MY-REGISTRY-USER",
          "password": "MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Where:

    - `EKS-CLUSTER-NAME` is the name as it appears in `eksctl get clusters`
    - `MY-REGISTRY-USER` is the user with write access to `MY-REGISTRY`.
    - `MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password for `MY-REGISTRY-USER`.
    - `MY-REGISTRY` is the container registry to which the Tanzu Application Platform images are located.

    For example:

    ```console
    aws secretsmanager create-secret \
       --name dev/${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}/tanzu-sync/install-registry-dockerconfig \
       --secret-string "$(cat <<EOF
    {
     "auths": {
       "${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}": {
         "username": "${INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME}",
         "password": "${INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD}"
       }
     }
    }
    EOF
    )"
    ```

3. Review the hosted Git URL and branch Tanzu Sync should use.

    This configuration was generated by the `configure.sh` script. It reported:

    ```console
    ...
    wrote non-sensitive Tanzu Sync configuration to: tanzu-sync/app/values/tanzu-sync.yaml
    ...
    ```

    For example, for the `iterate-green` cluster, if the Git repository is hosted
    on GitHub at `my-organization/tap-gitops` on the `main` branch, `tanzu-sync.yaml`
    contains the following information:

    ```yaml
    ---
    git:
     url: git@github.com:my-organization/tap-gitops.git
     ref: origin/main
     sub_path: clusters/iterate-green/cluster-config
    ```

    You can review and edit these values as needed.

4. Review the integration with External Secrets Operator.

    This configuration was generated by the `configure.sh` script. It reported:

    ```console
    ...
    wrote ESO configuration for Tanzu Sync to: tanzu-sync/app/values/tanzu-sync-eso.yaml
    ...
    ```

    For example, for the `iterate-green` cluster, if the AWS account is `665100000000`,
    `tanzu-sync-eso.yaml` contains the following information:

    ```yaml
    ---
    secrets:
     eso:
       aws:
         region: us-west-2
         tanzu_sync_secrets:
           role_arn: arn:aws:iam::665100000000:role/iterate-green--tanzu-sync-secrets
       remote_refs:
         sync_git_ssh:
           ssh_private_key:
             key: dev/iterate-green/tanzu-sync/sync-git-ssh
             property: ssh-privatekey
           ssh_known_hosts:
             key: dev/iterate-green/tanzu-sync/sync-git-ssh
             property: ssh-knownhosts
         install_registry_dockerconfig:
           dockerconfigjson:
             key: dev/iterate-green/tanzu-sync/install-registry-dockerconfig
    ```

    Where:

    - `role_arn` is the IAM role that grants permission to Tanzu Sync to read secrets specific to Tanzu Sync.
    This role was created in the [Grant read access to secret data](#grant-read-access-to-secret-data) section.
    - `ssh_private_key` is the AWS Secrets Manager secret name, as known as key,
    and JSON property that contains the private key portion of the SSH authentication
    to the Git repository created earlier.
    - `ssh_known_hosts` is the AWS Secrets Manager secret name, as known as key,
    and JSON property that contains the known host entries for the SSH authentication
    to the Git repository created earlier.
    - `install_registry_dockerconfig` contains the AWS Secrets Manager secret name
    that contains the Docker config authentication to the OCI registry hosting the
    Tanzu Application Platform images created earlier.

5. Commit the Tanzu Sync configuration.

    For example, for the "iterate-green" cluster, run:

    ```console
    git add tanzu-sync/
    git commit -m 'Configure Tanzu Sync on "iterate-green"'
    ```

### <a id='reviewstore-tap-installation-config'></a>Review and store Tanzu Application Platform installation config

Configuration for the Tanzu Application Platform installation are stored in two places:

- sensitive configuration is stored in AWS Secrets Manager;
- non-sensitive configuration is stored in YAML files in the Git repository.

Follow these steps to create the sensitive configuration and review the non-sensitive configuration:

1. Create a secret named `dev/${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}/tap/sensitive-values.yaml` that
stores the sensitive data such as username, password, private key from the `tap-values.yaml` file:

    ```console
    aws secretsmanager create-secret \
       --name dev/${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}/tap/sensitive-values.yaml \
       --secret-string "$(cat <<EOF
    ---
    # this document is intentionally initially blank.
    EOF
    )"
    ```

    You can start with an empty document and edit it later on in
    the [Configure and push the Tanzu Application Platform values](#configure-and-push-tap-values) section.

2. Review the integration with External Secrets Operator.

    This configuration was generated by the `configure.sh` script. It reported:

    ```console
    ...
    wrote ESO configuration for TAP Install to: cluster-config/values/tap-install-eso-values.yaml
    ...
    ```

    For example, for the `iterate-green` cluster, if the AWS account is `665100000000`,
    `tap-install-eso-values.yaml` contains the following information:

    ```yaml
    ---
    tap_install:
     secrets:
       eso:
         aws:
           region: us-west-2
           tap_install_secrets:
             role_arn: arn:aws:iam:665100000000:iterate-green--tap-install-secrets
         remote_refs:
           tap_sensitive_values:
             sensitive_tap_values_yaml:
               key: dev/iterate-green/tap/sensitive-values.yaml
    ```

    Where:

    - `role_arn` is the IAM role that grants permission to Tanzu Application Platform
    installation to read its associated secrets. This role was created in the
    [Grant read access to secret data](#grant-read-access-to-secret-data) section.
    - `sensitive_tap_values_yaml.key` is the AWS Secrets Manager secret name that
    contains the sensitive data from the `tap-values.yaml` file for this cluster in a YAML format.

3. Commit the Tanzu Application Platform installation configuration.

    For example, for the `iterate-green` cluster, run:

    ```console
    git add cluster-config/
    git commit -m 'Configure installer for TAP 1.5.0 on "iterate-green"'
    ```

## <a id='configure-and-push-tap-values'></a>Configure and push the Tanzu Application Platform values

The configuration for the Tanzu Application Platform is divided into two separate locations:

- sensitive configuration is stored in a AWS Secrets Manager secret created as described
  in the [Review and store Tanzu Application Platform installation config](#reviewstore-tap-installation-config) section.
- non-sensitive configuration is stored in a plain YAML file `cluster-config/values/tap-values.yaml`

Follow these steps to split the Tanzu Application Platform values:

1. Create the file `cluster-config/values/tap-values.yaml` by using the [Full Profile (AWS)](../install-aws/profile.hbs.md#full-profile)
which contains the minimum configurations required to deploy Tanzu Application Platform on AWS.

    The Tanzu Application Platform values are input configurations to the Tanzu Application Platform installation
    and are placed under the `tap_install.values` path.

    ```yaml
    tap_install:
      values:
        # Tanzu Application Platform values go here.
        shared:
          ingress_domain: "INGRESS-DOMAIN"
        ceip_policy_disclosed: true
    ...
    ```

    To install Tanzu Application Service in an offline environment, you must configure `Tanzu Build Service` and `Grype` to work in an air-gapped environment:

    ```yaml
    ---
    tap_install:
      values:
        ...
        buildservice:
          exclude_dependencies: true
        grype:
          db:
            dbUpdateUrl: INTERNAL-VULN-DB-URL
    ```

    Where:

    - `INTERNAL-VULN-DB-URL` is the URL that points to the internal file server.

    For more information, see [Components and installation profiles](../about-package-profiles.hbs.md).

1. Review the contents of `tap-values.yaml` and move all sensitive values into
the AWS Secrets Store secret created in the [Review and store Tanzu Application Platform installation config](#reviewstore-tap-installation-config) section.

    For example, if the `iterate-green` cluster is configured with the basic Out of the Box Supply Chain,
    this might include a passphrase for that supply chain's GitOps flow:

    ```yaml
    ---
    tap_install:
     values:
       ...
       ootb_supply_chain_basic:
         registry:
           server: "SERVER-NAME"
           repository: "REPO-NAME"
         gitops:
           ssh_secret: "SSH-SECRET-KEY"   # <== sensitive value; do not commit to Git repository!
       ...
    ```

    To maintain the secrecy of `ootb_supply_chain_basic.gitops.ssh_secret`,
    move this value from the `tap-values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    ---
    tap_install:
     values:
       ...
       ootb_supply_chain_basic:
         registry:
           server: "SERVER-NAME"
           repository: "REPO-NAME"
       ...
    ```

    Add it to the AWS Secrets Store secret named `dev/iterate-green/tap/sensitive-values.yaml`,
    by default, without the `tap_install.values` root:

    ```yaml
    ---
    ...
    ootb_supply_chain_basic:
     gitops:
       ssh_secret: "SSH-SECRET-KEY"
    ...
    ```

    To update the secret value, follow the instructions in
    [Modify an AWS Secrets Manager secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_update-secret.html).

    When moving values, you must omit the `tap_install.values` root,
    but keep the remaining structure.
    All of the parent keys, for example, `ootb_supply_chain_basic.gitops` of the moved value,
    for example, `ssh_secret`, must be copied to the sensitive value YAML.

1. Commit and push the Tanzu Application Platform values:

    ```console
    git add cluster-config/
    git commit -m "Configure initial values for TAP 1.5.0"
    git push
    ```

    Tanzu Sync fetches configuration from the hosted clone of the Git repository.
    For changes to take effect on the cluster, they must be pushed to that clone of the Git repository.

## <a id='deploy-tanzu-sync'></a>Deploy Tanzu Sync

Deploying Tanzu Sync kickstarts the GitOps workflow that initiates the Tanzu Application Platform installation.

After deployed, Tanzu Sync periodically polls the Git repository for changes.
The following deployment process is only required once per cluster:

1. Install the Carvel tools `kapp` and `ytt` onto your `$PATH`:

    ```console
    sudo cp $HOME/tanzu-cluster-essentials/kapp /usr/local/bin/kapp
    sudo cp $HOME/tanzu-cluster-essentials/ytt /usr/local/bin/ytt
    ```

    This step is required to ensure the correct deployment of the `tanzu-sync` App.

1. Ensure the Kubernetes cluster context is set to the EKS cluster.

    1. List the existing contexts:

        ```console
        kubectl config get-contexts
        ```

    1. Set the context to the cluster that you want to deploy:

        ```console
        kubectl config use-context CONTEXT-NAME
        ```

        Where `CONTEXT-NAME` can be retrieved from the outputs of the previous step.

1. Bootstrap the deployment.

    External Secrets Operator is installed from the package included in the
    Tanzu Application Plaform package repository.
    That repository must be fetched from the OCI registry initially.

    1. Set the following environment variables:

        ```console
        export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=MY-REGISTRY
        export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=MY-REGISTRY-USER
        export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD
        ```

        Where:

        - `MY-REGISTRY` is your container registry.
        - `MY-REGISTRY-USER` is the user with read access to `MY-REGISTRY`.
        - `MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password for `MY-REGISTRY-USER`.

    1. Create a secret containing credentials to fetch from that OCI registry by using the provided script:

        ```console
        tanzu-sync/scripts/bootstrap.sh
        ```

        These credentials are used exactly once to install the External Secrets Operator (ESO) package.

1. Install Tanzu Sync and start the GitOps workflow by deploying it to the cluster using `kapp` and `ytt`.

    ```console
    tanzu-sync/scripts/deploy.sh
    ```

    Depending on the profile and components included, it may take 5-10 minutes for the Tanzu Application Platform to install.
    During this time, `kapp` waits for the deployment of Tanzu Sync to reconcile successfully. This is normal.

    You can track the progress of the installation by watching the installation of those packages in a separate terminal window:

    ```console
    watch kubectl get pkgi -n tap-install
    ```

<!-- TODO: Write a "How-To" guide for changing the names of AWS Resources -->
<!-- ## <a id='custom-aws-resource-names'></a>Using Custom Names for AWS Resources

The following sections describe creating a set of secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Once a secret is created in AWS Secrets Manager, it cannot be renamed; it must be recreated under a new name.

The default names for the required AWS Secrets Manager Secrets are:
- `dev/EKS-CLUSTER-NAME/tanzu-sync/sync-git-ssh` : SSH authentication credentials to the hosted git repository
- `dev/EKS-CLUSTER-NAME/tanzu-sync/install-registry-dockerconfig` : OCI registry credentials to be used to install Tanzu Application Platform packages
- `dev/EKS-CLUSTER-NAME/tap/sensitive-values.yaml`: the portion of the Tanzu Application Platform values that are sensitive

where `EKS-CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the cluster as it appears in `eksctl get clusters`

If this convention meets the need, follow the instructions below, as is.

If another convention is needed:
- replace the default name with the custom one while following the instructions -->
